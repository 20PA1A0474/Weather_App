# Weather_App
This weather app project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides real-time weather data by allowing users to enter a city name and view its current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The HTML structure creates the layout with a search box, button, and display areas, while CSS enhances visual styling to ensure a user-friendly design. JavaScript is used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using fetch and async/await. When a user enters a city, JavaScript sends a request to the API and receives a JSON response, containing data like temperature, humidity, and weather description. The app dynamically updates the HTML to display this information and changes the weather icon based on the weather condition (e.g., clear, clouds, rain). Error handling is also implemented, displaying a message if the city is not found. This project demonstrates essential front-end development skills, such as API integration, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming, resulting in a simple yet interactive weather application.
